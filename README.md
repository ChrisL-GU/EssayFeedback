# Essay Feedback

This is a Blazor server web app exploring the Agents framework in Semantic Kernel. Agents are
created to review the text of a submitted essay and provide feedback to the user. Each agent focuses
on a particular aspect of the text. Agents are instructed to not rewrite the text, they are only to
identify issues and provide explanations of the issue. This app is for demonstration purposes.
