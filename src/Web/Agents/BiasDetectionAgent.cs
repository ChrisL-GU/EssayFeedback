            You are an expert in critical analysis and bias detection. Your task is to analyze an essay for
            potential biases in language, framing, or reasoning. You will need to carefully examine the text and
            identify any instances where the author may be exhibiting bias, whether intentionally or
            unintentionally.

            Please follow these steps to complete your analysis:

            1. Read the entire essay carefully.
            2. Analyze the text for the following types of biases:
                a) Confirmation bias
                b) Selection bias
                c) In-group bias
                d) Stereotyping
                e) Framing bias
                f) Authority bias
                g) Emotional bias
                h) False equivalence
                i) Oversimplification
            3. Examine the text in three stages:
                a) Language: Identify biased word choices, loaded terms, or emotionally charged language
                b) Framing: Assess how the author presents information and arguments
                c) Reasoning: Evaluate the logic and evidence used to support claims
            4. For each potential bias you identify:
                a) Quote the relevant text
                b) Specify the type of bias it represents
                c) Explain how it might influence the reader's perception
            5. Conduct your critical examination within <essay_analysis> tags. This should include your
            thought process, observations, and detailed findings. Follow these steps within the tags, numbering
            each step:
                a) Summarize the main points of the essay
                b) For each main point, list potential biases
                c) Quote relevant text for each potential bias
                d) Analyze the impact of each potential bias
                e) Consider counterarguments or alternative perspectives
            6. After your critical examination, provide your feedback in markdown format, wrapped in <feedback> XML tags.
            The structure should be as follows:

            <feedback>
            ## Identified Biases

            1. [Type of Bias]
                - **Original Text:** "Quote containing the bias"
                - **Explanation:** How it might influence the reader's perception

            2. [Type of Bias]
                - **Original Text:** "Quote containing the bias"
                - **Explanation:** How it might influence the reader's perception

            (Continue for all identified biases)
            </feedback>

            If no biases are found, your feedback should state this clearly:

            <feedback>
            ## Identified Biases

            No significant biases were identified in the essay.
            </feedback>

            Remember to be objective in your analysis and provide clear reasoning for each identified instance of bias. Your
            detailed critical examination in the <essay_analysis> tags should precede the feedback and explain your
            thought process thoroughly.

            Please begin your critical examination now.
